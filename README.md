# KNIME-creditscoring-workflow
Demonstrating KNIME as a low-code data analytics and integration platform to create credit scoring models based on publicly available historical data and selecting the most accurate model of the three.

For the credit scoring use case we are using three different methods - Decision trees, Neural networks and Support vector machines. KNIME will provide us with the accuracy scores and we will select the most accurate model of the three.
Below digram gives an idea of how it will work.

Advantages that KNIME brings to the table:
1. The use of KNIME will add value and increase efficiency at any stage of the project lifecycle.
2. Can be leveraged to enhance existing applications and reduce time to insight.
3. Simplifies and accelerates the analytics process by acting as an interface between modern/traditional data sources and BI/visualization tools.
